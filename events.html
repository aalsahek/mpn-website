              <p class="body-text section__sub">Faith Inspired Leadership brought our community together for a purposeful and uplifting picnic focused on learning, reflection, and collective responsibility. Against the beautiful backdrop of Töölönlahti, participants engaged in insightful conversations about the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, guided by impactful reflections from our guest speaker, Mohammad Khlouf. The discussions highlighted the ethical and spiritual importance of intentional action, justice, and faith-driven leadership.</p>
              <p class="body-text section__sub">Beyond inspiration, the event translated awareness into meaningful impact. With warm weather, great company, and strong engagement, attendees connected, learned, and contributed generously, successfully raising €825 to support Gaza. The food, Crafts4Gaza initiative, and authentic sense of solidarity created a memorable experience that reinforced how collective commitment and values-based leadership can truly make a difference.</p>
